# ABOUT PROJECT
This project is a simple File Integrity Checker built using Python. It calculates the SHA-256 hash of a file to verify its integrity. SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function that generates a unique 256-bit hash value for any given file.

Features:-
‚úÖ Accepts file path input from the user.
‚úÖ Calculates the SHA-256 hash of the file.
‚úÖ Displays the hash value to verify file integrity.
‚úÖ Handles file reading errors gracefully.
‚úÖ (Optional) Displays output in a graphical window using tkinter.
‚úÖ (Optional) Saves the hash value to a text file (hash_output.txt) for future reference.

üèóÔ∏è How It Works:-
The program takes a file path as input.
It reads the file in chunks (to handle large files).
It computes the SHA-256 hash of the file content using the hashlib library.
The computed hash is displayed to the user.
(Optional) The hash value can be shown in a pop-up window or saved to a text file.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:-
Python ‚Äì Main programming language
hashlib ‚Äì For SHA-256 hashing
tkinter ‚Äì For graphical user interface (optional)
