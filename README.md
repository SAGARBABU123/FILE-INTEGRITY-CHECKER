This project is a simple File Integrity Checker built using Python. It calculates the SHA-256 hash of a file to verify its integrity. SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function that generates a unique 256-bit hash value for any given file.

Features:-
✅ Accepts file path input from the user.
✅ Calculates the SHA-256 hash of the file.
✅ Displays the hash value to verify file integrity.
✅ Handles file reading errors gracefully.
✅ (Optional) Displays output in a graphical window using tkinter.
✅ (Optional) Saves the hash value to a text file (hash_output.txt) for future reference.

🏗️ How It Works:-
The program takes a file path as input.
It reads the file in chunks (to handle large files).
It computes the SHA-256 hash of the file content using the hashlib library.
The computed hash is displayed to the user.
(Optional) The hash value can be shown in a pop-up window or saved to a text file.

🛠️ Technologies Used:-
Python – Main programming language
hashlib – For SHA-256 hashing
tkinter – For graphical user interface (optional)
